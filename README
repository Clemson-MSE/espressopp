INSTALL
=======

Installation in four steps:

1. Generate configure script 

autogen.sh        - makes the right calls of autoconf + automake
                  - Main input file is configure.ac

Please note: this is not mandatory for the users.

2. Configure the system

- the environment variable EXTRA_PREFIXES should be used to specify
  the directory of the boost installation and of the log4cxx 
  (alternatively log4cpp or nothing at all)

export EXTRA_PREFIXES="<boost_dir> <log4cxx_dir>"

- CXX should be set to a compile script that can deal with MPI

export CXX=mpicxx

See alsO:

configure --help

3. Make

make        ! genrates (executables + ) libraries

make check    ! generate and run test cases

4. Installation in own directory

make install

Note:   make install prefix=$HOME/EspressoPP
        (does not work at this time, installation directory must be set for configure)
